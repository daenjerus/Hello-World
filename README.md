# Hello-World
A small step to infinity

Just looking around and exploring the unknown with the guidance of a quarnsoure.
Still lost in this wilderness.
Found now?
Yes, I think. But let's try again to confirm.
Test again if not sure.
Another update for our fish of mind.
It's quite frustrating if the updates are not pushed from Brackets to Github.
To be honest, I feel dumb.
Just keep on pounding and it will sink.
YES! I think I got it now.. I guess???
